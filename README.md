## üîã Hybrid Technology

Hybrid vehicles combine an internal combustion engine (ICE) and one or more electric motors, along with a battery pack and power management system. These systems work together to optimize fuel usage, reduce emissions, and improve vehicle performance.

### üîß Why Hybrid?

- Traditional vehicles waste energy through idling and braking.
- Hybrids recover and reuse that energy.
- They switch intelligently between electric and fuel power.

### üß† How It Works (Simplified):

- At low speeds or during light acceleration, the electric motor powers the car.
- During high power demand (under high load conditions), the engine and motor work together.
- Regenerative braking converts braking energy into electricity to charge the battery.
- The ECU (Electronic Control Unit) manages this switching automatically.

## ‚õΩ Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) System

EFI replaces the older carburetor-based system with a more precise, computer-controlled system. It ensures accurate fuel delivery based on engine demands.

### üí° Why EFI?

- In a carburetor, fuel delivery depends on air pressure differences.
- In EFI, sensors feed data to the ECU, which calculates the exact amount of fuel needed ‚Äî real-time!

### üõ†Ô∏è How EFI Works

1. Air enters through the air filter and throttle body.
2. The **MAF** or **MAP** sensor measures the air.
3. The **ECU** calculates fuel amount and timing.
4. Fuel injectors spray fuel into the intake manifold or directly into the combustion chamber.
5. **Spark plug** ignites the mixture.

- **Rail Pressure Calculation**

### üß™ Petrol EFI

- Works with spark ignition engines.
- Port Injection: Sprays fuel just before the intake valve.
- Direct Injection: Sprays fuel directly into the combustion chamber ‚Äî more efficient but complex.

- **Direct Injection:**

### üîß Diesel EFI (Common Rail System)

- Diesel injectors use very high pressure (up to 2000+ bar).
- Common rail keeps pressure constant.
- The ECU controls timing, pressure, and duration of each injector.

## üîç Sensors and Actuators

Modern vehicles rely on dozens of sensors to collect data and actuators to perform actions based on that data.

### üì° Common Sensors and Their Functions

| CMP          | Camshaft Position Sensor      | Synchronizes injector timing              |
| IAT          | Intake Air Temperature        | Affects fuel-air mix in cold/hot weather  |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Actuators and Their Roles

| Actuator           | Function                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Fuel Injectors     | Deliver precise amount of fuel           |

2. **MAF/MAP sensors** measure incoming air.
3. ECU calculates the correct **fuel-air ratio**.
4. **Fuel injectors** deliver fuel into the manifold or cylinder.
5. **Spark plug** ignites the air-fuel mixture.
6. **O‚ÇÇ sensor** checks exhaust gas and reports to ECU.
7. ECU makes real-time adjustments (closed-loop control).
8. ECU reads throttle position, air temp, coolant temp.

### ‚ö° Hybrid System (Step-by-Step)

1. Vehicle starts in electric-only mode (if battery has enough charge).
2. ECU decides when to start the engine based on speed, load, or battery.
3. Engine and motor may work together during acceleration.
4. During braking or coasting, electric motor becomes a generator.
5. Captured energy is stored in the battery (regenerative braking).
6. All operations are managed by Hybrid Control Module (HCM).
